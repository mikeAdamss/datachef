## installation

Datachef can be installed from pypi via `pip install datachef`

_note: not true (yet) at time of writing_.


## example use case

Baseic usage is explained via a relatively simple example of transforming messy data into neat machine readable data. These kinds of contextual examples are typically the best way to communicate what the library does and why it may meet your own use case(s).

[see the example (opens a new window)](./example.html)  # note: holding file for now

## the datachef lab

The "lab" is a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to gradually introduce a new user to the full functionality of datachef via well documented, contextualised examples.

## real life use cases

A large repository of data transformation examples all using data chef. These are all real life use cases showing the transformation of messy open data to well strcutured machine readable data.

## development

In addition to the API documentation (see "SubModules" in the left hand menu) the [datachef github repo](https://github.com/mikeAdamss/datachef) also contains details on design choices, guidelines for contributing and an explanation of how the datachef api can be extended and customised.
