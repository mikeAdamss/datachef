## installation

Datachef can be installed from pypi via `pip install datachef`

_note: not true (yet) at time of writing_.

You can run datacheck via any python interpreter you want to, but the examples and documentation will tend to use Jupyter notebooks/labs/books as its html rendering works particularly well with the datachef preview functionality. 


## the datachef book

The "datachef book" is a series jupyter book (connected and organised jupyter notebooks) designed to gradually introduce a new user to the full functionality of datachef via well documented, contextualised examples.

- [see the example (opens a new window)](./example.html) to get an idea what datachef does and if it satisfies your use case(s) 
- [view the book (opens a new window)](./example.html)

## real life use cases

A repository of data transformation examples using datachef. These are all real life use cases showing the transformation of messy open data to well strcutured machine readable data.

## development

In addition to the API documentation (see "Submodules" in the left hand menu) the [datachef github repo](https://github.com/mikeAdamss/datachef) also contains details on design choices, guidelines for contributing and an explanation of how datachef can be extended and customised.
